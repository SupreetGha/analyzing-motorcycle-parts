### Project Overview
---
This project analyzes the wholesale net revenue generated by each product line, categorized by month and warehouse. The analysis provides insights into product performance and seasonal trends to inform strategic decisions.

#### Objective:

- Identify net revenue by calculating the difference between total revenue and payment fees for each product line.
- Group results by month and warehouse, sorting by product line and month, then net revenue in descending order.

### Data Sources

- Motorcycle Parts DataSet Provided by DataCamp

### Tools Used

- SQL - Data Analysis and Data Query

### SQL Query 

The SQL query calculates net revenue for each product line, grouped by month and warehouse. The results are sorted as follows:

- By product line.
- By month (June, July, August).
- By descending net revenue.

```sql
SELECT public.sales.product_line, 
       CASE WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 1 THEN 'January'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 2 THEN 'Febraury'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 3 THEN 'March'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 4 THEN 'April'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 5 THEN 'May'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 6 THEN 'June'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 7 THEN 'July'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 8 THEN 'August'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 9 THEN 'September'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 10 THEN 'October'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 11 THEN 'November'
	   WHEN EXTRACT(month FROM public.sales.date) = 12 THEN 'December'
	   ELSE 'N/A' END AS month,
       public.sales.warehouse,
       SUM(public.sales.total) - SUM(public.sales.payment_fee) AS net_revenue
FROM public.sales
WHERE public.sales.client_type = 'Wholesale'
GROUP BY public.sales.product_line, month, public.sales.warehouse
ORDER BY net_revenue DESC
```

### Findings
- Engines generate the most net revenue
- Parts that generate the most revenue are located either in the central or the north warehouses

### Recommendations

- Focus on understanding why Elextrical Systems generate the most revenue
- Analyze the West Warehouses' reason for lower performance

### Limitations

- Limited Timeframe: The analysis covers only three months (June, July, August). Results may not fully reflect annual or long-term trends.
- External Factors: The analysis does not account for external influences like market competition or economic shifts.
